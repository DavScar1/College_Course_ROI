# ROI Calculator Formula - Plain English

This document explains exactly how the calculator works, step by step.

---

## Overview

The calculator answers three key questions:
1. **How much will my degree cost?** (Total Cost)
2. **How long until I earn back that cost?** (Payback Period)
3. **Is this degree a good investment?** (ROI Percentage)

---

## The Math, Explained Simply

### Step 1: Calculate Total Education Cost
```
total_cost = tuition_per_year × course_length
```

**Example:**
- Computer Science at UCD
- Tuition: €7,000 per year
- Course length: 4 years
- **Total cost = €7,000 × 4 = €28,000**

**What this includes:**
- Tuition fees only
- Student contribution charge
- EU/Irish student rates

**What this DOESN'T include:**
- Accommodation
- Food and living expenses
- Books and materials
- Transport

---

### Step 2: Estimate Your Take-Home Pay
```
annual_net_income = starting_salary × 0.75
```

**Why 0.75?** This assumes 25% of your gross salary goes to:
- Income tax (PAYE)
- Universal Social Charge (USC)
- PRSI (social insurance)

**Example:**
- Starting salary: €35,000
- Tax rate: 25%
- **Take-home pay = €35,000 × 0.75 = €26,250 per year**

This is what actually lands in your bank account each year.

---

### Step 3: Calculate Payback Period
```
payback_years = total_cost ÷ annual_net_income
```

**What this means:** If you saved 100% of your take-home pay, how long would it take to recover your education cost?

**Example:**
- Total cost: €28,000
- Net income: €26,250
- **Payback = €28,000 ÷ €26,250 = 1.07 years**

**In reality:** 
- You won't save 100% of your income
- So multiply by 3-5x for realistic payback
- 1.07 years becomes ~3-5 years of actual savings

**What's a good payback period?**
- Under 2 years: Excellent
- 2-3 years: Very good
- 3-5 years: Good
- Over 5 years: Consider carefully

---

### Step 4: Project Future Salary
```
salary_after_5_years = starting_salary × growth_rate
```

**Growth rates by field:**
- Computer Science: 1.4x (40% increase)
- Engineering: 1.3x (30% increase)
- Business: 1.35x (35% increase)
- Law: 1.67x (67% increase)
- Medicine: 1.73x (73% increase)

**Example (Computer Science):**
- Starting: €35,000
- Growth rate: 1.4
- **After 5 years = €35,000 × 1.4 = €49,000**

**Why different rates?**
- Tech: Fast-growing industry, high demand
- Law: Big jump after qualification
- Medicine: Structured progression (Intern → SHO → Registrar)
- Engineering: Steady, reliable growth
- Business: Varies by sector

---

### Step 5: Calculate Average Salary Over 5 Years
```
average_salary_5y = (starting_salary + salary_after_5_years) ÷ 2
```

**Example:**
- Year 1: €35,000
- Year 5: €49,000
- **Average = (€35,000 + €49,000) ÷ 2 = €42,000**

This assumes linear growth from Year 1 to Year 5.

---

### Step 6: Calculate Total Earnings (5 Years)
```
total_earnings_5y = average_salary_5y × 5 × 0.75
```

**Example:**
- Average salary: €42,000
- Over 5 years: €42,000 × 5 = €210,000 (gross)
- After tax (0.75): €210,000 × 0.75 = **€157,500 (net)**

---

### Step 7: Calculate ROI Percentage
```
roi_percentage = ((total_earnings_5y - total_cost) ÷ total_cost) × 100
```

**Example:**
- Total earnings (5 years): €157,500
- Total cost: €28,000
- Profit: €157,500 - €28,000 = €129,500
- **ROI = (€129,500 ÷ €28,000) × 100 = 462%**

**What this means:** For every €1 you invest in education, you get back €4.62 over 5 years.

**What's a good ROI?**
- Over 400%: Excellent investment
- 300-400%: Very good
- 200-300%: Good
- 100-200%: Acceptable
- Under 100%: Questionable investment

## Real-World Example: Computer Science at UCD

Let's walk through the full calculation:

### Inputs
- Course: Computer Science - UCD
- Tuition: €7,000/year
- Course length: 4 years
- Starting salary: €35,000
- Salary after 5 years: €49,000

### Calculations

**1. Total Cost**
```
€7,000 × 4 = €28,000
```

**2. Net Income (Year 1)**
```
€35,000 × 0.75 = €26,250
```

**3. Payback Period**
```
€28,000 ÷ €26,250 = 1.1 years
```

**4. Average Salary (5 Years)**
```
(€35,000 + €49,000) ÷ 2 = €42,000
```

**5. Total Earnings (5 Years)**
```
€42,000 × 5 × 0.75 = €157,500
```

**6. ROI Percentage**
```
((€157,500 - €28,000) ÷ €28,000) × 100 = 462%
```

### Results Summary
- **Investment:** €28,000 over 4 years
- **5-Year Return:** €157,500 (after tax)
- **Profit:** €129,500
- **ROI:** 462%
- **Payback:** 1.1 years

**Translation:** Computer Science at UCD is an excellent investment.

## Important Caveats

### This Formula is SIMPLE on Purpose
- Real life is more complex
- Salaries don't grow linearly
- You might change careers
- Economic conditions change
- Individual results vary

### What Could Change Your Results

**Make ROI Higher:**
✅ Scholarships (reduce cost)
✅ Part-time work during college
✅ High-paying internships
✅ Working for top companies
✅ Moving to high-salary cities (Dublin, Cork)
✅ Specializing in high-demand areas

**Make ROI Lower:**
❌ Accommodation costs (€12k-€18k/year)
❌ Living expenses (€15k/year)
❌ Not finding a job immediately
❌ Career breaks
❌ Unemployment periods
❌ Lower-paying sectors

## Key Takeaways

1. **Tuition is only part of the cost** - Living expenses double or triple the real cost
2. **Payback period assumes you save everything** - Real payback is 3-5x longer
3. **ROI varies by field** - Tech and Law have highest returns in Ireland
4. **Starting salary matters most** - Higher starting salary = faster payback
5. **All these degrees have positive ROI** - Education is generally a good investment
